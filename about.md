    <p>Hi! I'm Alessandro Vogrig.<br>
I'm a thesist at Politecnico di Milano, an HAM radio operator and a maker. I also love taking photos and hiking (you can check my IG).<br>
My HAM radio callsign is IU2OZB and you can also find me on <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/iu2ozb">QRZ</a>.<br>
I have many ongoing projects and idea: here on Github are public available the (almost) finished ones or the abandoned ones left public for legacy.</p>
